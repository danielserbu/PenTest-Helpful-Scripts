# How it works
Set up index.php and script.js in the same folder. Set up a web server as such (or however else you want to) "python -m http.server 8080".
Then try payloads from payloads.txt into XSS vulnerable website until you receive a connection back.
Note: There for sure are more possible payloads you can try, check ze webz.
